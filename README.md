# FilmFinder

This is a small react app which I used to solidify my foundations with React-Redux.

The app is built with Typescript, and using npm as its package manager.

## Developing / Running

In order to start a development server, run `npm start` in the root directory of the project.

Changes made to the code of the app will be reflected on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

In order to deploy the app to GitHub Pages, run `npm run deploy,` which will (given the correct Git credentials) deploy the app to the URL given in the settings of the repository.
